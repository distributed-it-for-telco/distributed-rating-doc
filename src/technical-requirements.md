# Technical requirements (WIP)

## fraud / risk analysis

- is there a risk of a rating-agent doing non-legitimate modifications of its associated bucket / an other bucket?

- if those risks are too high, can we have "server-side" rating agent proxy to mitigate them?

## stateless agents

- how to manage efficiently agents configuration in a stateless word? (caching mechanisms / via dedicated local capability providers?)
