# Monorepo code organization

* Status: proposed
* Deciders:
* Date: YYYY.MM.DD

Technical Story: N/A

## Context and Problem Statement

Code organization in the distributed-agent prototype

## Decision Drivers

Simplicity, agility

## Considered Options

1. one unique repo for interfaces, agents and other artifacts

2. one repo for each artifact

## Decision Outcome

1. one unique repo for interfaces and agents

### Positive Consequences

- simple and agile, suited for a prototype

### Negative Consequences

- only one lifecycle (~release) for all artifacts

We will want to reassess this decision in the target implementation
